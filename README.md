# AirBnB-Profit-Analytics
**This project uses the Airbnb Listings 2016 dataset to find insights on profitable metrics when listing your property for renting.
Using Tableau, we have found insights on some important metrics when hosting listings on Airbnb.
All of the suggestions made are for the 2016 dataset and might not be applicable to the upcoming years.
Additionally, future datasets can be analyzed for more complex metrics for enhanced and updated decision making**

However, the reasons for choice can vary due to several factors such as marital status, affordability, place maintenance, etc.
